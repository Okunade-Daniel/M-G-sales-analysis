# Result
- There is a consistent rise in the total sales made between 2011 and 2013 then a dip in 2014. There is a huge rise in sales by 2015 and then followed by a huge dip in 2016. Though more quantity of products were bought in 2014 and 2016 the average price for which they are sold were lesser than the preceding year. This could have contributed to why we have a dip in sales value for the year 2014 and 2016.
- There is a slight increase in sales every July and August and a huge increase in sales every December. Also, December is a festive period, this can explain why accessories and clothing are ordered more than bikes products.
- There is moderate positive correlation between quantity purchased by a customer and profit made for accessories and bikes and a slightly weak positive correlation for clothing. Although this does not mean causation, it means profits and quantity increases in relation to one another.
- M&Gâ€™s youngest customer is 17 years old and the oldest is 87. 63778 (About 54 percent) of the customers are less than 37 years and fewer customers are between 77 and 97. Majority of the sales were also to customers between age 17 and 37.
- Most of the sales and profit were made off Male customers.
- There is no linear relationship between age and order_quantity as increase in age tells us nothing about quantity of product ordered.
